# Karoo Garmin Sync

This application will synchronize all rides from Hammerhead Karoo to Garmin Connect.

Usage: `python karoo_garmin_sync.py`

The firt time you run it, the app will generate `karoosync.cfg`. Edit that file and enter your account details. Then run the app again.

## Credits

I borrowed some code to connect to Karoo from [bakermat](https://github.com/bakermat/karoosync/blob/main/karoosync.py).
